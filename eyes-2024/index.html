      <p>Software Systems Engineering is the branch of Engineering which is concerned with the development of Software Systems and their life-cycles. A Software System can be comprised of Software (e.g. programs, code), Hardware (e.g. computers, smart phones), and development artifacts (e.g. diagrams, documentation). While most students primarily focus on developing software, you will get exposure to math, natural sciences, computer science, and electronics. Essentially you will learn to solve engineering problems by developing software as the primary component (but not only component) of the solution. Example areas of study include networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning, embedded systems, desktop and web applications, and game development. Software Development Life-cycles include the requirements, planning, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance and decommissioning of these systems.</p>

      <p>When most students think of Software Engineering they think of writing code. And while that is a key aspect of the role, there are other significant activities which exist outside of the code-writing scope. One of these activities is prototyping applications. Prototyping is an activity in which desginers and engineers create simple objects which represent a finished program, which could be a whiteboard sketch, a paper sketch, or a file produced using prototyping software, like Figma. In this activity we will investigate the prototyping Software Figma, then working together develop some new prototype apps.</p>

      <p>MakeCode Arcade is a free Game Engine created by Microsoft which runs in your browser. It allows rapid development of 2D pixel-art style games by simplifying your ability to create sprites, move and position them, detect collisions, play sounds and animations, and much more. Users can code games using a visual block-style or text-based languages JavaScript and Python.</p>

      <p>The games created with this engine can be run in your browser and shared, or loaded to handheld devices. Overall this tool is a great introduction to game development and programming.</p>

      <p>Begin by browsing to the MakeCode Arcade Website:</p>

      <p><a href="https://arcade.makecode.com/">https://arcade.makecode.com/</a></p>

      <p>We are going to start a new project:</p>

      <p><img src="res/new-project.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Name your project as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snake</code>, click Create, and away you go!</p>

      <p><img src="res/first-project-settings.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Hint: If you plan to make several projects, it may be a good idea to use your Microsoft Account to enable cloud storage. Otherwise your projects are saved to your browser.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the simulator on the left, which can be operated using keys on the keyboard</li>
        <li>The language selection at the top, which defaults to Blocks</li>
        <li>The block selector (middle)</li>
        <li>The block editor (right)</li>

<section id="makingacharacter"><button class="collapsible">Making a character</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>To begin, our snake needs a head. Let’s make this:</p>

      <p><img src="res/new-picture.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>For our sprite, we will make an Image</p>

      <p><img src="res/make-an-image.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>You can select drawing tools and colors on the right side, and color in your snakes’s head. Don’t just follow my lead, use your own artistic skills.</p>

      <p><img src="res/snake-head.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Once you are happy, be sure to name your image as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">face</code> and save it with Done. We’ll be able to look at this later.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="addingourfaceasourplayer"><button class="collapsible">Adding our face as our player</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>To add our face as our player, let’s start with the Block interface.</p>

      <p>Go to Sprites and grab the top Block. Then add it to the OnStart receptical.</p>

      <p>All of the lines of code in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on start</code> block will run every time the game starts up!</p>

      <p><img src="res/adding-the-face.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>This will result in your player being in your game:</p>

      <p><img src="res/player-in-game.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Let’s take a peak at what this looks like in Python code:</p>

      <p><img src="res/python.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Hint: You may need to use the dropdown to change from JavaScript to Python</p>

      <p>We can see a few things here, we have created a new variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mySprite</code>. This invoked a constructor of the sprites class called create, which looked in our assets folder for the face asset, and set the SpriteKind to player.</p>

      <p>Note: Switching back and forth between Blocks view and Python view can occasionally mess up your Blocks layout or your python formatting. We will go back and forth for a bit before committing to Python.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="movingourplayer"><button class="collapsible">Moving our player</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>Let’s hop back to the Blocks view, and start to create the code to move our player around:</p>

      <p><img src="res/pressing-a-button.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>This creates an event, that occurs whenever a button is pressed:</p>

      <p><img src="res/change-a-property.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>When the event occurs, we want to change a property of our sprite, namely the x-position. Configure it as follows:</p>

      <p><img src="res/change-position.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>We want to move our player 16 pixels at a time, as this is the space of one tile.</p>

      <p>Hint: The game world in MakeCode arcade uses an XY coordinate system, like you saw in math, but the origin is at the top left, and with the y-axis flipped so that positive y-values move down:</p>

      <p><img src="res/coordinate-system.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>This means that, to move left, we had to move in the negative-x direction. Based on this knowledge, can you figure out how to set the remaining 3 directions? Try to figure it out before you peek the solution ahead.</p>

      <p><img src="res/moving-in-four-directions.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Demo your game, you should be able to move your snake head all around the game.</p>

      <p>However, if you have actually played snake, you know that the snake does not move when you press buttons, but instead moves automatically at a set interval. In the next section we will modify our code to make the snake instead move automatically.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="gameupdateloopautomovingsnake"><button class="collapsible">Game Update Loop - Auto moving snake</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>Let’s talk about the idea of a game loop. This is a piece of code that runs at a set interval. MakeCode Arcade had a built in function for this, but we are going to create our own so that we can modify how fast the game runs. For this we will need a variable and a loop.</p>

      <p>Start by creating a new variable called delay. This will be set to 640 (ms) in the On Start function.</p>

      <p><img src="res/set-a-variable.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>We want to rename the variable to delay</p>

      <p><img src="res/rename.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Set the variable name to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delay</code> and the value to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">640</code>, and then sync it into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on start</code> block</p>

      <p><img src="res/delay.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Now we will use this delay in a forever loop. We will grab the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forever</code> block from the Loops module, and place in the Pause function.</p>

      <p><img src="res/forever-and-pause.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Put them together, but rather than using a fixed value for the pause, we are going to use the delay variable we chose earlier:</p>

      <p><img src="res/grabbing-a-variable.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Let’s put it all together:</p>

      <p><img src="res/forever-pause-delay.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>This block of code will run, and then pause for our delay time, about 2/3rds of a second. After that any code that follows it will run. Once that code is complete, it will loop again, beginning with the pause. This allows us to make a game loop with variable time, which will be useful for later on to speed up the game dynamically as the player gets better at it.</p>

      <p>Let’s try automatically moving our player down each update cycle by copying the “down” instruction from our controller and placing it after the delay.</p>

      <p>Hint: You can copy and paste a block by selecting it, then pressing ctrl+c then ctrl+v.</p>

      <p><img src="res/auto-down.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>When you play now, you should see your player basically fall off the screen. We will handle that in the next section.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="snakesteering"><button class="collapsible">Snake Steering</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>We don’t want our player to only move down. We want it to move in a direction you chooose. This means it needs to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>know which direction it’s currently going</li>
        <li>try to change direction if you press a button
          <ul>
            <li>But it can only turn to one of the two sides. It can’t reverse, and going forward again wouldn’t change anything.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is going to require two varaibles, and some conditional logic.</p>

      <p>Let’s start by setting up two new variables in our starting function:</p>

      <p>create variables called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">current_direction</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">next_direction</code>.</p>

      <p>Hint: new variable blocks will default to variables you have already created. To make an new variable, explicitly click New variable…</p>

      <p><img src="res/new-variable.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>We want to set these variables to a new type, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Text</code>. To do this we are going to need to grab some Text boxes from the Text function and drag them in.</p>

      <p><img src="res/text-directions.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>This will allow you to type text in the box. Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">down</code> in each box, so that your new variables look as follows:</p>

      <p><img src="res/steering-variables.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Next let’s use conditional logic to move our snake based on the direction it is currently moving:</p>

      <p>We will need a condition block to check which direction it is moving, and go from there:</p>

      <p><img src="res/logic.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>What this block does is checks if a condition is met, and if it is performs some code. Otherwise it runs some other code. We acually need 4 branches, one for each direction. You can do this by hitting the (+) on the bottom of the block.</p>

      <p><img src="res/four-branches.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>What we want to do in these four branches is see which direction is set, and based on that, move our player. Let’s grab a text comparison block:</p>

      <p><img src="res/text-comparison-block.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Let’s put it into the top three branches of our comparator:</p>

      <p><img src="res/setting-up-comparisons.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>On the left side of each of these, we want to use our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">current_direction</code> variable. On the right side, we need to type in the words <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">left</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">right</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">up</code>. We won’t need to do down, since by process of elimination, if we are not moving in any of these three directions, we must be moving down!</p>

      <p><img src="res/setting-up-comparisons-2.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Now we just need to move the code for moving from the controller to the conditions in the appropriate place:</p>

      <p><img src="res/moving-around-code.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Now we will move correctly based on the direction. However, our controllers are empty.</p>

      <p>Let’s fix this by using them to set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">next_direction</code> variable in each of the four directions. You should know how to do this by now. As a hint, don’t forget to grab the Text data type from the Text block in advanced:</p>

      <p><img src="res/setting-directions.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>The reason we have two sets of directions, next_direction and current_direction, is because our snake can only go from some directions to others. It can’t go backwards, and it can’t go forwards. This means this is actually a rudimentary finite state machine.</p>

      <p>However, currently there are no limits on how far your snake can move.</p>

      <p>Let’s use some conditional logic next to make sure the snake stays in bounds</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="losingifwegooutofbounds"><button class="collapsible">Losing if we go out of bounds</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>To make our snake die if we go out of bounds, we will need to use some conditional logic to check it’s position, and if it is off the screen, give a game over:</p>
