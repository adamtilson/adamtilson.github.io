      <p>The purpose of this lab is to briefly introduce the View component of the MVC, and particularly to introduce the Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML). In this tutorial we will explore the building blocks of the front end of the web by discussing the different elements that make up the View, what they do and how they interact. We will then focus especially on HTML, the core building block of all websites.</p>

      <p><img src="res/node-stack.svg" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Over the next four weeks we will focus on different parts of the View. We will then look at the Controller for two weeks, and the Model for two weeks. We’ll come back to this often to remind you how everything works.</p>

      <p>Hopefully by continuing to refer to this diagram, it will be clear how the different components of the system are functioning together. (This was a point students struggled with last year.)</p>

<section id="part2theview"><button class="collapsible">Part 2: The View</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>In Web Development (web dev) there are three types of files used to render the front end which users see: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sometimes these are generated by front-end libraries, like Angular, React, Vue, or incorporate useful libraries like BootStrap or jQuery, but fundamentally these are the technologies browsers run on. Your browser requests these files, they are delivered from a server over the internet, and then rendered in the browser.</p>

      <h3 id="html">HTML</h3>

      <p>In modern web dev, HTML is used only to specify which components will appear on the page, and define order and hierarchy (parent-child relationship, akin to a tree data-structure). If we think of front-end web dev as building a house, HTML is the blueprint and bricks. You can build a web site using only HTML, though it will probably look like a <a href="http://www.oocities.org/">90’s geocites website</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="css">CSS</h3>

      <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style the website. This makes the elements appear where and how you want them to appear. In our analogy of building a house, CSS are the decorations. A popular library for CSS is BootStrap, which standardizes and speeds up design. We’ll look at CSS in Lab 3.</p>

      <h3 id="javascript">JavaScript</h3>

      <p>JavaScript is a programming language which runs in the browser, for adding animations and simple interactions with the website through the Document Object Model (DOM). For security reasons, there are limits to what can be done in JavaScript. In our house analogy, JavaScript is the electricity, it makes things work. We’ll look at JavaScript in Lab 4, and a popular extension, JQuery, in lab 5.</p>

      <h3 id="single-responsibility">Single Responsibility</h3>

      <p>In Software Engineering, Single Responsibility principle is the idea that each module should only perform one task. We will broadly follow this concept in this course. In other words, HTML should only handle object instantiation, CSS should only handle styling, etc. However, we will see several way we can violate this, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>styling elements through HTML tags</li>
        <li>adding web elements using the JavaScript through the DOM
As much as possible, we want to avoid using these components for unintended purposes! It makes code harder to read, understand and change.</li>
      </ul>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="part3markuptohtml"><button class="collapsible">Part 3: Markup to HTML</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>HTML is The only required element of a website. HTML is made up of XML-like tags which surround the content and further describe what type of content it is.</p>

      <h3 id="markup">Markup</h3>

      <p>The term markup comes from manuscript submission, where the editor would make notes describing <em>how</em> we would like to print text. For example, underline this, emphasize this, etc.</p>

      <p>Modern markup languages similarly employs tags to explain how we want the text to be rendered. There is a default rendering style, (which is arguably pretty antiquated) and custom rendering styles, while we will look at later using CSS. For now, the important take away is that we are using HTML to explain <strong>the purpose</strong> of the enclosed content, regardless of the visual presentation, which we will fine tune later.</p>

      <h3 id="quick-example">Quick Example:</h3>

      <p>Let’s try an example using a classic text, Bram Stoker’s Dracula:</p>

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL

(Kept in shorthand.)

3 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.

      <p>Without any context, each chunk of text looks exactly the same.</p>

      <p><img src="res/wall-of-text.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>How do we differentiate one from another? Here’s how Project Gutenberg renders the same text.</p>

      <p><img src="res/dracula-formatted.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Can we do this? Let’s start by pasting this into a new file in vs code…</p>

      <h3 id="main-entry-point-indexhtml">Main entry point: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code></h3>

      <p>By default, the main file in html is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. Let’s create a new file called index.html and paste this in.</p>

      <p><img src="res/untouched-manuscript.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>We can preview this file in a browser by double-clicking the HTML file in our file browser…</p>

      <p>Beautiful. Let’s start annotating it with HTML tags. The chapter section is a title, let’s embed it in a heading tag, h1.</p>

</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>What does this look like:</p>

      <p><img src="res/h1-preview.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Not exactly the way that we want, but we have achieved our goal of “marking up” the text - we have successfully described that the purpose of this text is to act as a heading. While there are methods for changing the appearance in HTML, we’ll leave this for CSS next week. Recall - single responsibility!</p>

      <p>Let’s add some more tags…</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;hr&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>CHAPTER I<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>3 May. Bistritz.<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span>—Left Munich at 8:35 P.

</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>How does the preview look now?</p>

      <p><img src="res/more-tags.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>We added a horizontal rule (hr), lower-level heading (h2), the emphasis tag, and the paragraph tag. Note that the paragraph tag encloses the emphasis tag, an example of nested tags (hierarchy).</p>

      <p>While our browser is rendering our file correctly, it is not exactly compliant HTML. This is because we are missing some necessary boilerplate tags.</p>

      <h3 id="boilerplate-html">Boilerplate HTML</h3>

      <p>Boilerplate refers to standard, preprinted text, as might be stampled on a boiler. In programming languages, this is the minimum code needed to make the language run and be compliant. You’ve likely already seen the c++ boilerplate…</p>

      <div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">"Hello World!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>As you know, this is the bare minumum code to do anything in c++. A similar principle applies to HTML. We can create the boilerplate in VS Code using Emmet and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> key.</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">"en"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">charset=</span><span class="s">"UTF-8"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">http-equiv=</span><span class="s">"X-UA-Compatible"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"IE=edge"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"viewport"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Document<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>But where does our text go? It needs to go into the body tags of the boilerplate. While we’re at it, let’s change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;title&gt;</code> tags inner HTML as well:</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

<section id="part4tags"><button class="collapsible">Part 4: Tags</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>Let’s break down how HTML is composed.</p>

      <p>The objects in angled braces are called tags</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Many tags surround text, formatting it and/or adding functionality
          <ul>
            <li>When surrounding text, the closing tag uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;/h1&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tags can surround other tags, this forms the tree of the page. Adjacent elements are siblings, while nested elements have a parent-child relationship.</li>
        <li>The standard boilerplate tags make the tree:
          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>html
 |--- head
 |     `--- title
 |
 `--- body
</code></pre></div>          </div>
        </li>
        <li>We typically want this tree to expressed in our HTML source document through indentation, but this can be done automatically with Code Formatters.</li>
        <li>Some are self-closing, which mean they don’t surround text, e.g.<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;hr&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Some tags require attributes to give them further functionality</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="position-block-and-inline">Position, Block and Inline</h3>

      <p>Nearly everything about how HTML elements can be displayed can be overwritten with CSS, which we will look at next week, however for now there are a few important concepts to help understand how elements will be displayed:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>In general, elements will be placed into the page in the order in which they are defined in the document</li>
        <li>There are two major display types for elements:
          <ul>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Block</code> elements will always start on a new line, and take up the full width</li>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Inline</code> elements will be placed adjacent to existing elements</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We’ve already seen this - the headers were blocking elements, while the emphasis tags were inline.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">W3Schools on Block and Inline</a></p>

      <h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>

      <p>If we think of a tag is like a function in programming, attributes are like the named arguments to that function. They have names and values, and depending on those values may change their behaviour. For example, we looked at the horizontal rule. We can make it wider with:</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;hr</span> <span class="na">size=</span><span class="s">"3"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>This is an example of using an attribute to change a visual style.</p>

      <p>However, this violates one of our rules (single responsibility), since we are attempting to apply style using HTML. It is better to do this through CSS, so this approach is not advised, thus many attributes are deprecated, though some are still required.</p>

      <p>There are other attributes which we will need to use which do not change style, but change other functionality, such as link destination and image source.</p>

      <h3 id="container-tags">Container tags</h3>

      <p>Some HTML tags exist to give functionality to the enclosing text, but others simply contain text to describe the text’s purpose, and/or be styled later with CSS. Use of these tags is highly recommended by the HTML5 Standard…</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>tag</th>
            <th>usage</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Generic blocking container</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Generic inline container</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;header&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies header content</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;footer&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies footer content</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;main&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies main content</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;section&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies a section</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;article&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies an article</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies the navigation</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>These are highly recommended for search engine optimization. Proper use of these tags may also aid accessibility, like reader view, text to speech, etc.</p>

      <h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

      <p>You may be tempted to use tables for arrange content… don’t do it! We’ll look at a much better method next week. For now, use tables only for tabular data. Tables provide an example of a component which requires nested tags in a particular order. Example table:</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nt">&lt;table&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>Name<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>ID<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>Location<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Ash<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>01234<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Pallet<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Brock<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>78452<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Pewter<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Misty<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>85246<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Cerulean<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/table&gt;</span> 
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>Which renders as…</p>

      <p><img src="res/table.png" alt="" /></p>

      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;table&gt;</code> tags signifies this is a table.
          <ul>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;tr&gt;</code> tag encolose each row
              <ul>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;th&gt;</code> tags enclose each header cell,</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;td&gt;</code> tags enclose each data cell.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Be sure to close in the tags in the opposite order that you open!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="forms">Forms</h3>

      <p>Finally, we will occasionally want to collect information from the user. This is handled through the form elements.</p>

      <p>Here’s an example form:</p>

      <p>Form Example: Mail Me!</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Email Me!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">"mailto:adamtilson@gmail.com"</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">"post"</span> <span class="na">enctype=</span><span class="s">"text/plain"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Your name<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"name"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">"email"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Your email<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"email"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"email"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"email"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">"message"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Your message<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;textarea</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"message"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"message"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>What does this look like?</p>

      <p><img src="res/email-form.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>These tags work slightly different than the ones we’ve seen so far. Things to note:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The entire object is wrapped in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;form&gt;</code> tag.</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;label&gt;</code> tag explains the purpose of a form element, and specifically states which one through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> attribute.</li>
        <li>Many types of input objects share the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input&gt;</code> tag
          <ul>
            <li>The specific type of object is varied through the use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> attribute
              <ul>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> 	Single-line text input field</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</code> 	Radio button (select one of many choices)</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</code> 	Checkbox (select zero or more of many choices)</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code> 	Submit button (submits the form)</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="button"&gt;</code>   Generic button. Can be attached to a JavaScript function.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> attributes uniquely identify the form object.
              <ul>
                <li>There can only be one element with a given name in an HTML document.</li>
                <li>It’s best practices to match the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> attribute to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> attribute.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> provides a default value for the o</li>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">placeholder</code> provides a placeholder value for text, which must be overridden by the user</li>
            <li>the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action</code> attribute shows the destination of the form</li>
            <li>the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">method</code> attribute shows how the form will be submitted, e.g. through GET or POST</li>
            <li>some tag types even give simple validation, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="email"&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">The W3Schools Form Tutorial</a> is very good.</p>

      <h3 id="learning-from-existing-sites">Learning from Existing Sites</h3>

      <p>If you want to see which tag a site is using for a specific object, in Chrome or FireFox you can right click the object and go to Inspect.</p>

      <h3 id="which-types-of-tags-should-i-use">Which types of tags should I use?</h3>
      <p>You always want to use the tag which best conveys the meaning of your marked up text. So, for emphasizing text which is rendered in italics, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code> is better than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;i&gt;</code>.</p>

      <p>For the lab project, we are going to be making a multi-user to-do list application. The final version of it will look similar to this:</p>

      <p><img src="res/login-styled.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p><img src="res/register-styled.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p><img src="res/todo-page-styled.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>However, if you take away the styling, it looks much more humble:</p>

      <p><img src="res/login-page-just-html.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p><img src="res/todo-page-just-html.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>For this lab you are to implement the HTML for these two states.</p>

      <p>Recommended approach</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look at the pictures and identify potential HTML elements</li>
        <li>Is there one form? Multiple forms?</li>
        <li>It does not need to be perfect at this stage, because as you learn more with CSS next week, you may need to make some further adjustments to the HTML</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Submission:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This lab will be demoed by interview either in the week of 9/13 or 9/20.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Frequently asked questions:</p>

      <p>How do I add default text to the text inputs?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try the “Placeholder” attribute</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Does the form need any functionality?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not yet. We just need the layout for now. (Remember, single responsibility.)</li>

          <p>Adam’s Comments: An excellent overview of the Node Stack we’ll be looking at in this course. (And it regular goes on sale for about 30 bucks!)

            <li>I did this in all of my courses in University, trying to take a one-page reference sheet away from each one. This was especially helpful in courses that built on previous courses,</li>
