      <p>The purpose of this lab is to briefly introduce the View component of the MVC, and particularly to introduce the Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML). In this tutorial we will explore the building blocks of the front end of the web by discussing the different elements that make up the View, what they do and how they interact. We will then focus especially on HTML, the core building block of all websites.</p>

      <p>Over the course of the semester we will be working with the following technologies in the lab:</p>

      <p><img src="res/node-stack.svg" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Over the next four weeks we will focus on different parts of the View. We will then look at the Controller for two weeks, and the Model for two weeks. We’ll come back to this often to remind you how everything works.</p>

      <p>Hopefully by continuing to refer to this diagram, it will be clear how the different components of the system are functioning together. (This was a point students struggled with last year.)</p>

      <p><strong>Important: While these technologies are the key players in this version MVC, the MVC abstraction is not tied to any technology. That means you could implement an MVC using only HTML + JavaScript as long as you properly separate the view (html) from the model (JavaScript JSON Objects). We’ll disucss the MVC in more depth later!</strong></p>

<section id="part2theview"><button class="collapsible">Part 2: The View</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>In Web Development (web dev) there are three types of files used to render the front end which users see: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sometimes these are generated by front-end libraries, like Angular, React, Vue, or incorporate useful libraries like BootStrap or jQuery, but fundamentally these are the technologies browsers run on. Your browser requests these files, they are delivered from a server over the internet, and then rendered in the browser.</p>

      <h3 id="html">HTML</h3>

      <p>In modern web dev, HTML is used only to specify which components will appear on the page, and define order and hierarchy (parent-child relationship, akin to a tree data-structure). If we think of front-end web dev as building a house, HTML is the blueprint and bricks. You can build a web site using only HTML, though it will probably look like a <a href="http://www.oocities.org/">90’s geocites website</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="css">CSS</h3>

      <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style the website. This makes the elements appear where and how you want them to appear. In our analogy of building a house, CSS are the decorations. A popular library for CSS is BootStrap, which standardizes and speeds up design. We’ll look at CSS in Lab 3.</p>

      <h3 id="javascript">JavaScript</h3>

      <p>JavaScript is a programming language which runs in the browser, for adding animations and simple interactions with the website through the Document Object Model (DOM). For security reasons, there are limits to what can be done in JavaScript. In our house analogy, JavaScript is the electricity, it makes things work. We’ll look at JavaScript in Lab 4, and a popular extension, JQuery, in lab 5.</p>

      <h3 id="single-responsibility">Single Responsibility</h3>

      <p>In Software Engineering, Single Responsibility principle is the idea that each module should only perform one task. We will broadly follow this concept in this course. In other words, HTML should only handle object instantiation, CSS should only handle styling, etc. However, we will see several way we can violate this, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>styling elements through HTML tags</li>
        <li>adding web elements using the JavaScript through the DOM
As much as possible, we want to avoid using these modules for unintended purposes! It makes code harder to read, understand and change.</li>
      </ul>

<section id="part3markuptohtml"><button class="collapsible">Part 3: Markup to HTML</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>HTML is The only required element of a website. HTML is made up of XML-like tags which surround the content and further describe what type of content it is.</p>

      <h3 id="markup">Markup</h3>

      <p>The term markup comes from manuscript submission, where the editor would make notes describing <em>how</em> we would like to print text. For example, underline this, emphasize this, etc.</p>

      <p>Modern markup languages similarly employs tags to explain how we want the text to be rendered. There is a default rendering style, (which is arguably pretty antiquated) and custom rendering styles, while we will look at later using CSS. For now, the important take away is that we are using HTML to explain <strong>the purpose</strong> of the enclosed content, regardless of the visual presentation, which we will fine tune later.</p>

      <p>Let’s try an example using a classic text, Bram Stoker’s Dracula:</p>

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL

(Kept in shorthand.)

3 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.

      <p>Without any context, each chunk of text looks exactly the same.</p>

      <p><img src="res/wall-of-text.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>How do we differentiate one from another? Here’s how Project Gutenberg renders the same text.</p>

      <p><img src="res/dracula-formatted.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Can we do this? Let’s start by pasting this into a new file in vs code…</p>

      <h3 id="main-entry-point-indexhtml">Main entry point: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code></h3>

      <p>By default, the main file in html is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. Let’s create a new file called index.html and paste this in.</p>

      <p><img src="res/untouched-manuscript.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>We can preview this file in a browser by double-clicking the HTML file in our file browser…</p>

      <p><img src="res/wall-of-text.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Beautiful. Let’s start annotating it with HTML tags. The chapter section is a title, let’s embed it in a heading tag, h1.</p>

      <p>What does this look like:</p>

      <p><img src="res/h1-preview.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Not exactly the way that we want, but we have achieved our goal of “marking up” the text - we have successfully described that the purpose of this text is to act as a heading. While there are methods for changing the appearance in HTML, we’ll leave this for CSS next week. Recall - single responsibility!</p>

      <p>Let’s add some more tags…</p>

</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>How does the preview look now?</p>

      <p><img src="res/more-tags.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>We added a horizontal rule (hr), lower-level heading (h2), the emphasis tag, and the paragraph tag. Note that the paragraph tag encloses the emphasis tag, an example of nested tags (hierarchy).</p>

      <p>While our browser is rendering our file correctly, it is not exactly compliant HTML. This is because we are missing some necessary boilerplate tags.</p>

      <h3 id="boilerplate-html">Boilerplate HTML</h3>

      <p>Boilerplate refers to standard, preprinted text, as might be stamped on a boiler. In programming languages, this is the minimum code needed to make the language run and be compliant. You’ve likely already seen the c++ boilerplate…</p>

      <div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">"Hello World!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>As you know, this is the bare minumum code to do anything in c++. A similar principle applies to HTML. We can create the boilerplate in VS Code using Emmet and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> key.</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">"en"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">charset=</span><span class="s">"UTF-8"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">http-equiv=</span><span class="s">"X-UA-Compatible"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"IE=edge"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"viewport"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Document<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>But where does our text go? It needs to go into the body tags of the boilerplate. While we’re at it, let’s change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;title&gt;</code> tags inner HTML as well:</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

      <ul>
        <li>Many tags surround text, formatting it and/or adding functionality
          <ul>
            <li>When surrounding text, the closing tag uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;/h1&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tags can surround other tags, this forms the tree of the page. Adjacent elements are siblings, while nested elements have a parent-child relationship.</li>
        <li>The standard boilerplate tags make the tree:
          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>html
 |--- head
 |     `--- title
 |
 `--- body
</code></pre></div>          </div>
        </li>
        <li>We typically want this tree to expressed in our HTML source document through indentation, but this can be done automatically with Code Formatters.</li>
        <li>Some are self-closing, which mean they don’t surround text, e.g.<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;hr&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Some tags require attributes to give them further functionality</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="position-block-and-inline">Position, Block and Inline</h3>

      <p>Nearly everything about how HTML elements can be displayed can be overwritten with CSS, which we will look at next week, however for now there are a few important concepts to help understand how elements will be displayed:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>In general, elements will be placed into the page in the order in which they are defined in the document</li>
        <li>There are two major display types for elements:
          <ul>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Block</code> elements will always start on a new line, and take up the full width</li>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Inline</code> elements will be placed adjacent to existing elements</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We’ve already seen this - the headers were blocking elements, while the emphasis tags were inline.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">W3Schools on Block and Inline</a></p>

      <h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>

      <p>If we think of a tag is like a function in programming, attributes are like the named arguments to that function. They have names and values, and depending on those values may change their behaviour. For example, we looked at the horizontal rule. We can make it wider with:</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;hr</span> <span class="na">size=</span><span class="s">"3"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>This is an example of using an attribute to change a visual style.</p>

      <p>However, this violates one of our rules (single responsibility), since we are attempting to apply style using HTML. It is better to do this through CSS, so this approach is not advised, thus many attributes are deprecated, though some are still required.</p>

      <p>There are other attributes which we will need to use which do not change style, but change other functionality, such as link destination and image source.</p>

      <h3 id="container-tags">Container tags</h3>

      <p>Some HTML tags exist to give functionality to the enclosing text, but others simply contain text to describe the text’s purpose, and/or be styled later with CSS. Use of these tags is highly recommended by the HTML5 Standard…</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>tag</th>
            <th>usage</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Generic blocking container</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Generic inline container</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;header&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies header content</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;footer&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies footer content</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;main&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies main content</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;section&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies a section</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;article&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies an article</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Container that signifies the navigation</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>These are highly recommended for search engine optimization. Proper use of these tags may also aid accessibility, like reader view, text to speech, etc.</p>

      <h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

      <p>You may be tempted to use tables for arrange content… don’t do it! We’ll look at a much better method next week. For now, use tables only for tabular data. Tables provide an example of a component which requires nested tags in a particular order. Example table:</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nt">&lt;table&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>Name<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>ID<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>Location<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Ash<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>01234<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Pallet<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Brock<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>78452<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Pewter<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Misty<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>85246<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Cerulean<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/table&gt;</span> 
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>Which renders as…</p>

      <p><img src="res/table.png" alt="" /></p>

      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;table&gt;</code> tags signifies this is a table.
          <ul>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;tr&gt;</code> tag encolose each row
              <ul>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;th&gt;</code> tags enclose each header cell,</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;td&gt;</code> tags enclose each data cell.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Be sure to close in the tags in the opposite order that you open!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="forms">Forms</h3>

      <p>Finally, we will occasionally want to collect information from the user. This is handled through the form elements.</p>

      <p>Here’s an example form:</p>

      <p>Form Example: Mail Me!</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Email Me!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">"mailto:adamtilson@gmail.com"</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">"post"</span> <span class="na">enctype=</span><span class="s">"text/plain"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Your name<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"name"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">"email"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Your email<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"email"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"email"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"email"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">"message"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Your message<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;textarea</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"message"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"message"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>What does this look like?</p>

      <p><img src="res/email-form.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>These tags work slightly different than the ones we’ve seen so far. Things to note:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The entire object is wrapped in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;form&gt;</code> tag.</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;label&gt;</code> tag explains the purpose of a form element, and specifically states which one through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> attribute.</li>
        <li>Many types of input objects share the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input&gt;</code> tag
          <ul>
            <li>The specific type of object is varied through the use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> attribute
              <ul>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> 	Single-line text input field</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</code> 	Radio button (select one of many choices)</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</code> 	Checkbox (select zero or more of many choices)</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code> 	Submit button (submits the form)</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="button"&gt;</code>   Generic button. Can be attached to a JavaScript function.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> attributes uniquely identify the form object.
              <ul>
                <li>There can only be one element with a given name in an HTML document.</li>
                <li>It’s best practices to match the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> attribute to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> attribute.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> provides a default value for the o</li>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">placeholder</code> provides a placeholder value for text, which must be overridden by the user</li>
            <li>the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action</code> attribute shows the destination of the form</li>
            <li>the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">method</code> attribute shows how the form will be submitted, e.g. through GET or POST</li>
            <li>some tag types even give simple validation, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="email"&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">The W3Schools Form Tutorial</a> is very good.</p>

      <h3 id="learning-from-existing-sites">Learning from Existing Sites</h3>

      <p>If you want to see which tag a site is using for a specific object, in Chrome or FireFox you can right click the object and go to Inspect.</p>

      <h3 id="which-types-of-tags-should-i-use">Which types of tags should I use?</h3>

      <p>You always want to use the tag which best conveys the meaning of your marked up text. So, for emphasizing text which is rendered in italics, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code> is better than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;i&gt;</code>.</p>

      <h3 id="why-we-use-css">Why we use CSS</h3>

      <p>CSS is used to apply styles to our elements. This changes the way that they are rendered on the page, so they they no longer take on the default HTML which is reminiscent of the 90s.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Before CSS, we could only style elements with HTML attributes
          <ul>
            <li>This is slow and not very flexible
              <ul>
                <li>What if we want to reuse the same styles across elements? Across pages?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h3 id="where-to-add-css-code">Where to add CSS code?</h3>

      <p>CSS code can be applied inline, internal, external</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If a style conflict arises, these are the places you need to check!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Inline</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Embeds CSS code in an HTML tag using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">style</code> attribute.</li>
        <li>e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;hr style="width:50%;text-align:left;margin-left:0"&gt;</code>
          <ul>
            <li>Tedious and repetitive - need to apply style on a per element basis</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Internal</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write CSS code inside of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;style&gt;</code> tags in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> of the HTML document.</li>
        <li>Applies styles on a page-by-page basis
          <ul>
            <li>this is rarely optimal, we typically want site-wide styles</li>

      <h3 id="what-does-a-rule-look-like">What does a rule look like?</h3>

      <p>The basic CSS syntax is:</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">selector</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="py">property</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>who do we want this to apply to, what do we want to change, how do we want to change it</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="how-are-rules-applied-cascading">How are rules applied? Cascading</h3>

      <p>Cascading means styles inherit from other styles, i.e. “cascading down”.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Often rules will conflict, so we need to determine which style will apply, based on factors:
          <ul>
            <li>Importance: you can specify important tags with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!important</code></li>
            <li>Specificity: more specific rules (e.g. id’s) overrule less specific (e.g. classes, elements, or inherited)
              <ul>
                <li>Calculated with a complex scoring system.</li>
                <li>generally:
                  <ul>
                    <li>id &gt; class &gt; tag &gt; inherited</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Source order: later rules overrule earlier ones
              <ul>
                <li>If you are linking multiple style sheets, more general ones should come first, more specific ones later</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>It is sometimes tough to compute precedence in our head!
          <ul>
            <li>General heuristic: more specific rules will override less specific rules</li>
            <li>When learning and debugging: Use browser debug tools to see which styles are applying</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>And the following code into style.css</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>This shows how rules can be placed in three different places, and how they apply, both through inheritance (body inherits through to paragraph), by order (the internal style sections comes after the linked, so it will overrule it), and specificity (id overrules class overrules inherited). Fire up the debugger (F12), use the inspector, and trace how the CSS rules are overruled!</p>

      <h3 id="debugger">Debugger</h3>

      <p>In FireFox, you can open up the debugger with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F12</code>. You can use this to select elements and see which styles are applying:</p>

      <p><img src="res/css-debugger.png" alt="" /></p>

      <h3 id="default-style-sheet">Default Style Sheet</h3>

      <p>Every page has styles, unless you specify changes they uses the default style
This is what causes default styled HTML to look like it’s from the 90’s
It can be useful to understand these default styles to know which changes to make:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_default_values.asp">Here is a link to descriptions of the default values for a CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="res/default.css">Here is a link to the CSS in a style sheet file.</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="syntax-checking">Syntax Checking</h3>

      <p>VS Code checks your syntax as you type, look for common errors (bottom left)</p>

      <h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>

      <p>It’s best practice to Alphabetize Selectors and Properties 
    - it will make yours or your colleagues life easier at some point
Alternately, you may wish to group selectors by type, e.g. Tag, Class, ID</p>

      <h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>

      <p>CSS uses C-style comments:</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
    <span class="c">/* Make h1's red. */</span>

</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>This is a great tutorial, which acknowledges how wonky CSS can be sometimes:</p>

      <p>Next let’s examine some of the details which make CSS so powerful (and also so tricky!)</p>

      <h3 id="selectors">Selectors</h3>

      <p>Elements can be selected by a number of rules. Some rules select individual elements, others select groups. Further, some inheritance rules apply which will propagate through to children elements.</p>

      <h3 id="tag-selectors">Tag Selectors</h3>

      <p>Also known as element selectors. Applies style to all tags of that type. Very broad strokes.</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>This code will apply to all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags.</p>

      <h3 id="class-selector">Class Selector</h3>

      <p>Selects all elements of a given class.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can assign elements to a class in the HTML code using the HTML attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class="&lt;class_name&gt;"</code></li>
        <li>Multiple classes may be applied to a single object, separated by a space.
          <ul>
            <li>it’s best practice to only use one custom class, and attach others as needed by frameworks such as Bootstrap, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class="&lt;custom_class&gt; &lt;bootstrap_class&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>target them in CSS with the selector: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.&lt;class_name&gt;</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>e.g.</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>...
<span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"headers"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> Lab 3 <span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
...
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">.headers</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>This will apply to all tags that have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">headers</code> class assigned to the class list.</p>

      <h3 id="id-selector">Id Selector</h3>

      <p>Selects the single element identified with a particular ID.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can assign elements an ID in the HTML code using the HTML attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id="&lt;name&gt;"</code>.</li>
        <li>ID’s need to be unique, that is, only one element in a page may have a given ID.</li>
        <li>Target this element in CSS with the selector <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#&lt;id&gt;</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>e.g.</p>

      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>...
<span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"my-heading"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> Lab 3 <span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
...
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>only ever one id selector per object</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">#my-heading</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <h3 id="pseudo-classes">Pseudo Classes</h3>

      <p>Some elements have pseudo-classes that are active only during interaction, e.g. link hover
e.g.</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">a</span><span class="nd">:hover</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">Read more on MDN</a></p>

      <h3 id="combining-rules">Combining Rules</h3>

      <p>We can very specifically target an element by combining rules</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If we want to combine multiple selectors to select for a single element or set of elements, combine them without spaces</li>
      </ul>

      <p>e.g. apply this style to target all h1’s that have the header class:</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="nc">.header</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>We can also find elements which are descendants of an element:</p>

      <p>e.g. select all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code> elements that are children of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;section&gt;</code> tag:</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">section</span> <span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">yellow</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>There are other rules, for example selecting a particular child or sibling. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp">Check out this reference for more info.</a></p>

      <p>Simple is better - Before you commit to complicated combinational logic, decide if a custom class or ID would be better! Make your life easier and your code more traceable wherever possible!</p>

      <h3 id="common-properties-and-values">Common Properties and Values:</h3>

      <p>Color:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">color</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background-color</code> properties specify the foreground and background colors respectively</li>
        <li>color values can be given by keyword, or hex of the style: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#RRGGBB</code>
          <ul>
            <li>e.g. red is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#FF0000</code>, but will be very hard on the eyes, as we’ve seen!</li>
            <li>When starting, it’s strongly recommended not to find colors by experimentation, instead look at a palette app:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://colorhunt.co/">ColorHunt</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&amp;view.right=0">Google Material Design</a></li>

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you can’t tell if your styles are applying, start by applying something radical, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background-color: magenta</code>.
          <ul>
            <li>Thus you know the sheet is linked properly!</li>
          </ul>

                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">border-width: 5px;</code> - values are in px, e.g. 5px, 15px. You can also define the top, right, bottom and left widths in one statement. (clockwise from 12 o’clock)</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">border-color: red;</code> - values are colors</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">border-radius: 10px;</code> - curves the edges. value in px, e.g. 5px</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>specific properties:
              <ul>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">border-top-style: dashed;</code> - changes the style of the top side</li>
                <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">border-left-color: blue;</code> - changes the color of the left side</li>
                <li>Many other combinations are available</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>shorthand style
              <ul>

      <h3 id="div-and-span">Div and Span</h3>

      <p>Div and Span are HTML elements that exists only as a container for containing other elements</p>
      <ul>
        <li>can be used to apply CSS to elements</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> a vertical container, blocking</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code> is a horizontal container, non-blocking (inline)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="box-model">Box Model</h3>

      <p>The total space that an object takes is more than you might think, based on the CSS Box Model:</p>

      <p><img src="res/box-model.svg" alt="box model" /></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Individual objects have a required size, (implicit or defined <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">height</code>), and as they expand objects around them are pushed out of the way.</li>
        <li>But the total sizes of the element add the margin, padding, border and content to give the total dimensions of the element.
          <ul>
            <li>Margin and padding are buffer zones around the border.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Addition example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>10px border + 20px padding + 20px margin = 50px * 2 sides = 100px + content</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When setting margins, padding and border, the same four-sided shorthand can be used as we saw in borders, clockwise from the top:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>top, right, bottom, left</li>
            <li>remember: clockwise from 12 o’clock</li>
            <li>if only 1 value is given, it expands as (top=1, right=1, bottom=1, left=1)</li>
            <li>if 2 values are given, they expand as (top=1, right=2, bottom=1, left=2)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>This box model even applies to the body tag, which has a default non-zero margin.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is why by default elements aren’t positioned in the upper left  of the page</li>
        <li>
          <p>you will need to set this to 0 if you need something in the corner, like a header!</p>
        </li>
        <li>Padding will stretch the background color, whereas margin will add white around it</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="flow-and-the-css-display-property">Flow and the CSS Display Property</h3>

      <p>The Display property dictates how elements flow around this element:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display: block;</code> - push the next content to the next line. e.g. the default behaviour of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display: inline;</code> - let info come beside it. e.g. the default behaviour of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display:inline-block;</code> - A hybrid. It’s like inline, but it can block a bit of height too. e.g. the default behaviour of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;image&gt;</code>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_inline-block_span1">This w3schools example helps you learn the different</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display:none;</code> - don’t display it. It’s gone. Not just hidden. Items will not flow around it either, just take up it’s place.
          <ul>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visibility: hidden;</code> will instead allow items to flow around it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>There’s also a new flexbox model, designed to act as an alternative to this, but I think Bootstrap (which we’ll discuss later) accomplishes this better.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="css-positioning">CSS Positioning</h3>

      <p>Positioning is derived from HTML and CSS</p>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML should govern hierarchy and order
          <ul>
            <li>order means later elements are added to the flow after earlier elements</li>
            <li>Hierarchy means child elements appear “inside” of parents
              <ul>
                <li>Flow still applies</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>CSS positioning beings after HTML rules are complete
          <ul>
            <li>Positioning rules exist</li>
            <li>Depending on display properties, sometimes elements overlap
              <ul>
                <li>Z-index refers to the “depth” of objects, with higher numbers appearing on top, and lower or negative numbers behind.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;span&gt; Hello &lt;/span &gt; More text&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <h3 id="positioning-rules">Positioning Rules</h3>

      <p>Positioning can be derived from the HTML, or overridden, using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position</code> property, with values:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position: static;</code> - use the HTML rules for positioning</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position: relative;</code> - from the static position, offset the element by a specified x,y coordinate value, eg. (3, 5).
          <ul>
            <li>does not disrupt flow</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position: absolute;</code> - position the element by absolute coordinates relative to its parent
          <ul>
            <li>does disrupt document flow</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position: fixed;</code> - always in the same place as we scroll, e.g. a fixed header bar</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="centering-elements">Centering Elements</h3>

      <p>A common operation which can be harder than you might think!</p>

      <p>For non-blocking elements</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="nt">text-align</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">center</span><span class="o">;</span>   
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>For blocking elements:</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="nt">max-width</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="err">1000</span> <span class="nt">px</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="c">/* or whatever is appropriate*/</span>
    <span class="nt">margin</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="err">0</span> <span class="nt">auto</span> <span class="err">0</span> <span class="nt">auto</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="o">/*</span> <span class="nt">automatic</span> <span class="nt">centering</span> <span class="nt">left</span> <span class="nt">and</span> <span class="nt">right</span> <span class="o">*</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>You could also have instead done:</p>

      <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="nt">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="err">0</span> <span class="nt">auto</span><span class="o">;</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>Which will apply the 0 to both top and bottom, and auto to both left and right.</p>

      <h3 id="floating-and-clearing">Floating and Clearing</h3>

      <p>Floating allows images to “float” around text.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>values: none, left, right are common</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If something floats by default, you can remove float with the “clear” property.
eg:</p>

      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float: left;</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clear: left;</code></p>

      <p>Floating can be overused, easy to abuse. Be careful.

      <p>For the lab project, we are going to be making a multi-user to-do list application. The final version of it will look similar to this:</p>

      <p><img src="res/final-version.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>However, this version incorporates the bootstrap library, which we will look at next week.</p>

      <p>Without it, we instead have the somewhat more humble:</p>

      <p><img src="res/login-page-html-css.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p><img src="res/todo-page-css.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Your assignment this week is to create this version of the application. With CSS and HTML.</p>

      <p>Note: if we take away all of the styling and leave only the HTML, we get:</p>

      <p><img src="res/login-page-just-html.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p><img src="res/todo-page-just-html.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Recommended approach</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start by implementing the HTML only version
          <ul>
            <li>How many pages are there? What are their names?</li>
            <li>Look at the pictures and identify potential HTML elements</li>
            <li>Is there one form? Multiple forms?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Next implement the custom CSS
          <ul>
            <li>Which elements have changed due to custom CSS?</li>
            <li>How might you implement this change?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Submission:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This lab will be demoed by interview either in the week of 9/14 or 9/21.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Frequently asked questions:</p>

      <p>How do I add default text to the text inputs?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try the “Placeholder” HTML attribute</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Does the form need any functionality?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not yet. We just need the layout and basic styling for now.</li>
