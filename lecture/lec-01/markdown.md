## Discrete Mathematics 

![](bender-is-discreet.png)
---

## Defn: Discrete Mathematics

A branch of mathematics dealing with objects that can assume only discrete / distinct / seperate values
- e.g. The bit. (1 or 0)
- e.g. The integer.
  - The concept, not the data type
  - But also the data type! 
  - Most data types in computers (recall ENSE 352). 
- Natural numbers (Non-negative integers)
---

## Defn: Proof

A method of finding the truth
- Different meanings in different fields
- Courts
  - Legal evidence. Judge and jury.
- Science
  - Observations, experiments, sampling
- Authority. (Religion, Boss, Professor?)
- Conviction
- Burden of proof

---

## Defn: Math Proof

- A verification of a **proposition**
- starting from a set of **axioms**
- through a chain of **logical deductions**

---

## Defn: Propositions
- A statement that can be either true or false
- e.g. 2 + 3 = 5
- not: Hello.
- not: Is it raining?
- e.g.
$$ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n^2 + n + 41 \text{ is a prime number} $$ 

---

## Deciphering Math symbols

$$ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n^2 + n + 41 \text{ is a prime number}$$ 

"For all numbers n, in the set of natural numbers {0,1,2...}, $ n^2 + n + 41 $ is a prime number"


Is this true?

---

## Is this true?

$$ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n^2 + n + 41 \text{ is a prime number}$$ 

$n$ | $n^2 + n + 41$ | prime?
:-:|:-:|:-:
0  | 41 | yes
1  | 43 | yes
2  | 47 | yes
3  | 53 | yes
... | ... | ...
40  | 1681 |no: divisible by 41

Is there a more obvious example?

???

It's 41, because clearly it would be divisible from all 3 terms, 41^2, 41 and 41. What's divisible by each of the terms must be divisible by the sum.

---

## What about this?

$$ \exists a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}^+ , a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4 $$

There exists some numbers a,b,c,d in the set of positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4...} which satisfy this equation. Sure does!

- a = 95, 800
- b = 217, 519
- c = 414, 560
- d = 422, 480 

Euler believed this impossible in 1796, but a solution was found in 1988. How would you figure this out?!

???

So Proof by Authority doesn't work, even with  famous mathematicians!

---

## What about this?

$$ 313 (x^3 + y^3) = z^3 \text{ has no positive integer solutions} $$

The smallest counterexample has over 1000 digits

- Why should we care?
  - The concept of factoring large numbers is vital to modern cryptography algorithms employed today
  - If we could trivially factor these large numbers, we would need a new approach to cryptography
- More immediately, just plugging in a few numbers, observing a trend, and taking it as proof is a bad strategy

Examples (Are these implications T or F?):

  - Can it be cloudy and not raining?
- "It's Raining $ \Rightarrow $ It's Cloudy"
  - Can it be rainy with no clouds?
- If all dogs are good boys, then all chihuahuas are good boys.
  - If all dogs are good boys, but I have a naughty chihuahua, the implication must be false. As worded, it is true, since chihuahuas are a subset of dogs.
- If $n > 7$, then $n > 3$. ( $n>7 \Rightarrow n>3$ )

## Defn: Logical Equivalence 
- "Two statements are logically equivalent if, and only if, their resulting truth tables are identical for each variation of statement variables!*"

- We'll use the $\equiv$ symbol for this

.footnote[.red.bold[*] https://www.csm.ornl.gov/~sheldon/ds/sec1.1.html]

---

## Defn: Contrapositive
$$ (P \Rightarrow Q) \equiv (\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P) $$

$P$ | $Q$ | $\neg P$ | $\neg Q$ | $P \Rightarrow Q$ | $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$ |  $\equiv$
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
F|F|T|T|T|T|$\checkmark$
F|T|T|F|T|T|$\checkmark$
T|F|F|T|F|F|$\checkmark$
T|T|F|F|T|T|$\checkmark$

With implications, sometimes it's easier to prove the contrapositive!

---

## Contrapositive Examples
- If it is raining, then I take an umbrella
  - If I did not take an umbrella, then it is not raining
- If all dogs are good boys, then all chihuahuas are good boys
  - If not all chihuahuas are good boys, then not all dogs are good boys
  - If at least one chihuahua is bad, then not all dogs are good boys
* Contrapositive is the only negation that is logically equivalent to the positive!
---

## Converse
The converse of
$$ P \Rightarrow Q $$
is
$$ Q \Rightarrow P $$
Are these equivalent? How could we verify?
---

## Converse
$P$|$Q$|$P \Rightarrow Q$ | $Q \Rightarrow P$ | $\equiv $
---|---|---|---|---
T|T|T|T|$\checkmark$
T|F|F|T|$\times$
F|T|T|F|$\times$
F|F|T|T|$\checkmark$
---

## Inverse
The inverse of
$$ P \Rightarrow Q $$
is
$$ \neg P \Rightarrow \neg Q $$
Are these equivalent? How could we verify?
---
## Inverse
$P$ | $Q$ | $\neg P$ | $\neg Q$ | $P \Rightarrow Q$ | $\neg P \Rightarrow \neg Q$ |  $\equiv$
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
T|T|F|F|T|T|$\checkmark$
T|F|F|T|F|T|$\times$
F|T|T|F|T|F|$\times$
F|F|T|T|T|T|$\checkmark$
Is this logically equivalent to anything we've already looked at? By which rules are they logically equivalent?
???
Yep. Converse is logically equivalent to the inverse. 
This is because the converse is the contrapositive of the inverse. 
My head hurts.

---
## Predicate
A proposition whose truth value depends on the value of a variable, or multiple variables
- e.g. "$n$ is a prime number"
- e.g. $P(n) := $"$n^2+1$ is a prime number"
  - P(1) = True
  - P(2) = True
  - P(3) ??? 
???
It's false.

---
## Quantifiers

Universal $\forall$
- Always
- For every, For all

Existential $\exists$
- There exists
- Sometimes

---
## Ambiguity

"Every American has a Dream"
- Easy to make ambiguity mistakes in English. 
- Every American has the same Dream?
- Every American has a different Dream?
---

## Resolving Ambiguity with Predicate Logic
"Every American has a Dream"

let D be the set of all possible Dreams

let A be the set of all Americans

$H(a,d) :=$ American, $a$, has Dream, $d$

$$ \forall a \in A, \exists d \in D, H(a,d). $$
$$ \exists d \in D, \forall a \in A, H(a,d). $$

???

In the first one, all Americans have the a different dream
In the second one, all americans have the same dream.
The first part sets up the domain.
---
## Examples

Aristotle is a man

Let a := Aristotle

Let M := the set of all men

$\exists x \in M, x = a$

All men are mortal, thus Aristotle is mortal

Let R := the set of all mortals

$\exists x \in M, x = a \Rightarrow a \in R$

---
## Domains

$\mathbb{N} = {0, 1, 2, ...}$

$\mathbb{Z} = {... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}$

$\mathbb{Z}^+ = {1, 2, 3, ...}$

$\mathbb{Z}^- = {... -3, -2, -1}$

You can define subsets as needed:

- Let Evens := "The set of all even integers"
- Let Primes := "The set of all prime numbers"
---

## Goldbach Conjecture
"Every even number greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers"

Let Evens := the set of even numbers > 2.

$$ \forall n \in \text{Evens}, \exists p \in \text{Primes},  \exists q \in \text{Primes}, n = p + q.  $$

$$ \forall n \in \text{Evens}, \exists p, q \in \text{Primes}, n = p + q.  $$

---
## Negating Quantifiers

$$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n)$$

$$\neg (\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n)) \equiv \exists n \in \mathbb{N}, \neg P(n)$$

$$ \neg (\exists n \in \mathbb{N}, Q(n)) \equiv \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \neg Q(n) $$

???

This too hurts my head

---

## Satisfiability of a Proposition
- There exists at least one way to set the variable which makes the proposition true
- e.g. $ P \wedge (\neg P) $ is not satisfiable

---

## Validity of a Proposition

- A proposition is valid if it evaluates to true regardless of the values assigned to the individual variables
- e.g. we know this equivalence is valid:
$$ (P \Rightarrow Q) \equiv (\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P) $$
What about:
$$ (P \Rightarrow Q) \equiv (Q \Rightarrow P) $$
- Satisfiable, (If P and Q are both false or true) but not Valid!
